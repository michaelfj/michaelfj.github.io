		<p>Bringing Biological Resonance to Your Smart Phone</p>
		<p>Hi There. This is the web page for a hypothetical product that has not yet been built. The page is designed to gauge your interest in owning it. If you get to the end of our pitch and think you want one, we want you to click the button. You will not be charged anything but you might want to register your interest by sending us your email address. Because if you decide that you do want one, and it eventually does get built, then you might want to be one of the first to own one.</p>
