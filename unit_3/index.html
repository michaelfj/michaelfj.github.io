		<h3>Bringing Biological Resonance to Your Smart Phone</p>
		<p>Hi There. This is the web page for a hypothetical product that has not yet been built. The page is designed to gauge your interest in owning it. If you get to the end of our pitch and think you want one, we want you to click the button. You will not be charged anything but you might want to register your interest by sending us your email address. Because if you decide that you do want one, and it eventually does get built, then you might want to be one of the first to own one.</p>

 		<p>Deterioration in your performance can occur because of a combination of factors:
		<ul> <li>Poor dietary choices</li>
			 <li>Poor immune system performance</li>
			 <li>Excessive anxiety</li>
			 <li>Reduced sleep quality</li>
			 <li>Hormonal irregularities</li>
			 <li>Inflammmation of joints and muscles</li>
			 <li>Poor digestive function</li></ul>
		<p>The SPx6 will offer a wide range of testing and broadcast options to look at all of these factors in some detail.</P>
