			<p>Hi There. This is the web page for a sports performance product idea that is well-advanced but has not yet been built. The page is designed to gauge your interest in owning it. If you get to the end of our pitch and think you might want one, we want you to click the registration link. You will not be charged anything but if you register your interest now by sending us your email address, then you might be one of the first to own one. Owning one might just give you the edge that need in your golf or tennis group, or against the opposition to your local team.</p>

			<p>Some days you wake up feeling like a "square peg in a round hole" as they say in English. Deterioration in your performance can occur because of a variety of factors, including poor dietary choices. You might want to come to read our <a href="#">diet advice section</a> later to put you on the right track to better sports nutrition.</P>

			<article class="gizmo">
			<p>So what is the product, and how does it work? Put as simply as possible, it will be a small neat-looking gizmo that you carry in your pocket or underwear that broadcasts signals from your smart phone into your body via a Bluetooth signal. These signals have been created by our medical expert, a doctor who worked with athletes for many years to improve their performance. It will look a bit like the image below and be about the size of a credit card with rounded corners.</p>

			<article class="science">
			<p>The science behind the device is based on decades of research but we are not going to reveal the mechanism behind our device at this stage of development. The gizmo will record that pattern and send it to our website for special processing. Our processing will identify signals that will give you more energy and make your body run better. These signals will be sent back to your smart phone to be broadcast to your gizmo for a few hours each day or once a week or whenever you might want to use it.</p>
