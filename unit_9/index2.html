Deterioration in your performance can occur because of a variety of factors.<br><br>So this is the web page for a radical new sports performance product that is well-advanced in the design phase but has not yet been built. The page is designed to gauge your interest in owning one of our units. If you get to the end of our pitch and think you might want one, we want you to click the registration link.<br><br>You will not be charged anything but if you register your interest by sending us a brief email, then you might be one of the first to own one. Owning one might just give you the edge that need in your game, whether that might be against your sports group, or against your local opposition team.</p>

					<p>Deterioration in your performance can occur because of poor dietary choices. You might want to come to read our <a href="#">diet advice section</a> to put you on the right track to better sports nutrition.<br><br>
					So what is the product, and how does it work? Put as simply as possible, it will be a small neat-looking gizmo that you carry in your pocket or underwear that broadcasts signals from your smart phone into your body via a Bluetooth signal. These signals have been created by our medical expert, a holistic doctor who worked with athletes for 20 years to improve their performance.<br><br>It will look a bit like the image below and be about the size of a credit card.</p>

					<p>The science behind the device is based on the phenomenon of electromagnetic (EM) resonance in biology. The device be carried against your body and will emit subtle vibrations that will dislodge carbon monoxide (CO) from the mitochondria in your cells. We live in polluted environments with milions of vehicles and toxic CO builds up in our bodies and blocks the production of energy. Less carbon monoxide in your body means more energy in both your brain and muscles leading to better performance.<br><br> We will recommend that these signals be broadcast to the device from your smart phone for a few hours each week. Timing is important is any sports programme and we will advise the best timing.</br><br>
					The use of drugs is frowned upon in sport, especially at high levels. Our product will offer a totally-legal drug-free method to improve performance in your chosen sport.</p>

					<p>Is there any research available to read, are there any testimonials yet? Well no, it has not been built yet, but the system has been in use for some years via a much larger device. The feedback is good, very good.<br><br>

We are looking to select people of different ages and genders who play different sports to see what their experience is with the device.<br><br>
					What will this system cost? It won't be that expensive but we do not have an exact cost yet. Perhaps let us know what you think you might be prepared to pay for it.<br><br>
