					<p>Hi There. Some days you wake up feeling like a "square peg in a round hole" as they say in English. Deterioration in your performance can occur because of a variety of factors.<br><br>So this is the web page for a radical new sports performance product that is well-advanced in the design phase but has not yet been built. The page is designed to gauge your interest in owning one of our units. If you get to the end of our pitch and think you might want one, we want you to click the registration link.<br><br>You will not be charged anything but if you register your interest by sending us a brief email, then you might be one of the first to own one. Owning one might just give you the edge that need in your game, whether that might be against your sports group, or against your local opposition team.</p>

					<p>Deterioration in your performance can occur because of poor dietary choices. You might want to come to read our diet advice sections to put you on the right track to better sports nutrition. Click on the links to the right.<br><br>
					So what is the product, and how does it work? Put as simply as possible, it will be a small neat-looking gizmo that you carry in your pocket or underwear that broadcasts signals from your smart phone into your body via a Bluetooth signal. These signals have been created by our medical expert, a holistic doctor who worked athletes for 20 years to improve their performance.<br><br>It will look a bit like the image below and be about the size of a credit card (but with rounded corners so it does not cut into your clothing).</p>

					<p>The science behind the device is based on decades of research but we are not going to reveal the exact mechanism behind our device at this stage. The device will be used to record your energy pattern and the signal will be processed by our software (installed at no cost to you on your smart phone).<br><br>The programme will identify signals that will give you more energy to make your body run better. We recommend that these signals be broadcast to the device for a few hours each day. Timing is important is any sports programme and we will advise the best timing.</br><br>
					The use of drugs is frowned upon in sport, especially at high levels. Our product will offer a totally-legal drug-free method to improve your performance in your chosen sport.</p>
