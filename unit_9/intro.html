				<h3>The top toxic moulds</h3>
				<p>Whether you use the word 'mold' or 'mould' to describe them, one important factor in human health is the presence on and in the body of toxin-producing fungi. These microbes can infect many places - on our skin, in our nose and mouth, in our bowel, in our brain and internal organs where they colonise the small blood vessels, and along the membranes lining our body cavities.</p>
				<img class="columnimg" src="images/Spiral.Cauli4.HR.780px.gif">
				<p>Fungus can only live internally by producing toxins that block the immune system.  Medical science recognizes that the three most difficult organisms to remove are the fungi Aspergillus and Fusarium, and the yeast Candida Albicans. The fungi Eurotium and Stachybotris are next most toxic. Of the 100 or so known microbial toxins, Aspergillus and Fusarium produce almost 70 between them.<br> There also exist pathogenic fungi that do not produce toxins such as Cryptococcus, but they need either a suppressed immune system or a toxin-producing fungus to survive in the body cavities. The top toxic fungi can survive in our bodies even when our immunity is quite good.</p></article>

				<p>This website will explore the ways fungi can get into our bodies, how we can best prevent exposure, and how we can rid our body of these germs. The material presented here was written by a now-retired holistic medical practitioner with decades of experience in treating fungal disease.</p>

				<h3>Aspergillus</h3>
				<p>Without doubt the top fungus on our planet is Aspergillus. There are over 150 species many of which are pathogenic to  humans. In addition to over 30 complex toxins such as the aflatoxins, this mould also produces a wide range of hydrocarbon toxins, a byproduct of its ability to recycle organic matter into its basic units.<br>Aspergillus contaminates nuts, cereals, cheeses, spices and legumes, and care must be taken both handling and consuming these products. Products like peanut butter are frequently contaminated. Organic foods are often contaminated as they are not sprayed with fungicides.<br>
				Fungus grows best in humid dark places in our houses and gardens.

				<p>Inhaling spores can lead to chronic infections of the sinus, throat and lungs. The fungus appears to copy the hydrocarbons in its environment. If you are infected on an aircraft by Aspergillus in the recycled air, it is likely that this strain will make compounds similiar to aviation fuel. Once in your body the strain will release these compounds to try to block your white blood cells.</p>

				<h3>Fusarium</h3>
				<p>Apart from farmers, market gardeners, and scientific researchers, most people have never heard of Fusarium, the second most prolific toxin producer. Fusarium is known to colonise up to 90% of wheat and 70% of oat crops. The popularity of raw muesli, cereal brans, and wheat biscuits has increased our exposure to the mould in the past few decades. One toxin , Cyclosporin-A, is so good at suppressing our immune system that it is used as a drug to prevent transplant rejection and treat auto-immune disease. If Fusarium colonises your body, it can produce this toxin to thwart your immune system.</p>
