				<h3>Candida</h3>
				<p>Many patients are familiar with Candida Albicans, the cause of oral and vaginal thrush. Candida can be much more serious however, making a toxin called acetaldehyde to thwart the immune system as it invades the body. This is the same chemical that forms in the body when alcohol breaks down - many patients who cannot tolerate alcohol have a heavy overgrowth of Candida.</p>
				<img class="columnimg" src="images/Banana2.HR.780x267.gif">
				<p>The widespread heavy metal mercury seems to promote the growth of this yeast and Candida sufferers should perhaps avoid farmed and predatory fish, as well as foods often fertilised with fish products such as cashews, citrus fruit and tomatoes. The amount of mercury in the ocean has risen by 75 percent in the past 20 years and may be wise for some folks to avoid fish and fish products generally.<br>
				How do we go about reducing our exposure to toxic moulds and also reducing the amount in our bodies? A lot of the food that we buy is potentially mouldy and it is often food sold to us as the healthy option.</p>

				<p>This includes nuts, grains, legumes, fresh and dried fruits, brans and cereals, especially produce labelled 'organic'. Mould and yeast colonise the surfaces of all these products and many are grown in humid tropical countries, carted to market, transported in damp conditions on ships, then stored in warehouses and production plants before processing and packaging. There are thus many opportunities for mould contamination.</p>

				<h3>Fungus in Your Food</h3>
				<p>How do we know our food is free of mould? Some foods are meant to be mouldy - specialty French cheeses are encased in mould, and cheeses such as blue-vein are skewered with mould on copper wires so that they grow inside the cheese. Soy sauce is fermented using the Aspergillus fungus and 'vegetarian' digestive enzymes are in fact extracted from Aspergillus cultures. You would be surprised if these foods were not moudy and most of us eat them straight from the packet and sprinkle them on our food without giving it a second thought!

				<h3>Spices</h3>
				<p>Pepper is a case in point. We put unwashed raw pepper onto our meal. Pepper is a seed collected from the ground in hot humid countries and known to often be contaminated with the toxic Aspergillus. We also allow waiters in restaurants to do the same with their often large fancy grinders. Do they ever wash those grinders or sterilize the pepper corns first? Most of the spices we use in the kitchen are also made from ground up nuts and bark which could be moldy.<br>
				Do you use cinnamon? Is it retrieved from your spice store in its raw state and sprinkled on your food? It is the bark of a tree and will probaly be moldy. Keep it in the freezer.</p>

				<h3>Tip</h3>
				<p>It is safer to cook all spices and herbs into your food. If you store spices at head height or above in little packets and bottles be careful handling them so that they do not end up in your nose and sinuses where the molds can cause chronic sinusitis and sore throat.</p>
