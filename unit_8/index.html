				<p>Column 1 text. One very important factor in human disease is the presence in the body of toxin-producing mould and yeast infections. These infections can occur in many places in our solid organs, in the bowel, in the blood vessels and lymphatics, and on the skin and mucous membranes.The three most difficult organisms to remove are the yeast Candida Albicans, and the moulds Aspergillus and Fusarium. Of the 100 or so known fungal toxins, these two poduce almost 70. These moulds contaminate nuts, cereals, cheeses and legumes, and care must be taken both handling and consuming these products.</p><br>

				<p>Column 2 text. Commercial nut butters (ie. peanut butter) are well known to be frequently contaminated. Organic foods made from cereals and legumes are often contaminated as they are not sprayed.</p> 
				<img class="columnimg" src="images/Coriander2.HR.780px.gif">
				<p>Environmental contamination is also common in the damp and dark areas of our houses and mould spores can cause chronic infections of the sinus, throat and lungs. Aspergillus mould can produce more toxins than any other organism. The best known are the Aflatoxins, liver carcinogens that can block  our white blood cells from destroying it. This can lead to poor immune function in an infected tissue.</p><br>

			<h2>Column 3</h2>
			<article class="article">
				<p>Column 3 text. Most people except market gardeners, drug and military researchers, have never heard of the Fusarium mould, the second most prolific toxin producer. Fusarium is known to colonise up to 90% of wheat and 70% of oat crops. The popularity of raw muesli, cereal brans, and wheat biscuits has increased our exposure to the mould in the past few decades. One toxin , Cyclosporin-A, is so good at suppressing our immune system that it is used as a drug to prevent transplant rejection and treat auto-immune disease.</p>

				<p>If Fusarium colonises your body, it can produce this toxin to thwart your immune system.</p><br>
