				<p>Column 1 text. One very important factor in human disease is the presence in the body of toxin-producing mould and yeast infections. These infections can occur in many places â€“ in our solid organs, in the bowel, in the blood vessels and lymphatics, and on the skin and mucous membranes.The three most difficult organisms to remove are the yeast Candida Albicans, and the moulds Aspergillus and Fusarium. Of the 100 or so known fungal toxins in nature, these two species produce almost 70. These moulds commonly contaminate nuts, cereals and legumes.</p>

				<p>Column 2 text. Commercial nut butters (ie. peanut butter) are well known to be frequently contaminated. Organic foods made from cereals and legumes are also very often contaminated. Environmental contamination is also common in the damp and dark areas of our houses and mould spores can cause chronic infections of the sinus, throat and lungs. Aspergillus mould can produce more toxins than any other organism. The best known are the Aflatoxins that can block the efforts by our white blood cells to destroy the mould. This can lead to poor immune function in an infected tissue.</p>

			<h2>Column 3</h2>
			<article class="article">
				<p>Column 3 text. Most people except market gardeners, pharmaceutical and military researchers have ever heard of this mould. It is the second most prolific toxin producer. Fusarium is known to colonise almost 90% of wheat and 70% of oat crops. The popularity of raw muesli, cereal brans, and wheat biscuits has increased our exposure to the mould in the past few decades. One toxin , Cyclosporin-A, is so good at suppressing our immune system that it is used commercially as a drug to prevent transplant organ rejection and treat auto-immune disease. If Fusarium colonises your body, it can produce this toxin to thwart your immune system.</p>
